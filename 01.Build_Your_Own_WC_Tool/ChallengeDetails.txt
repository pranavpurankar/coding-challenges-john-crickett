''' Build Your Own WC(Word Count) Tool '''

This challenge is to build your own version of the Unix command line tool wc!

The unix command line tools are a great metaphor for good software engineering and they
follow the Unix Philosophies of:
• Writing simple parts connected by clean interfaces - each tool does just one thing and
  provides a simple CLI that handles text input from either files or files streams

• Design program to be connected to other programs - each tool can be easily connected to
  other tools to create incredibly powerful compositions

Following this philosophies has made the simple unix command line tools some of the most
widely used software engineering tools - allowing us to create cery complex text data
processing pipelines from simple command line tools.
